# [Populations.js Models](https://github.com/concord-consortium/populations-models)

This repository hosts a collection of models built using [populations.js](https://github.com/concord-consortium/populations.js).

To view the models running, see
[http://concord-consortium.github.io/populations-models/](http://concord-consortium.github.io/populations-models/)

## Running Locally

This project is built using Brunch.io, which compiles the CoffeeScript,
stylesheets, and other assets.

### Dependencies

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/) `brew install node`
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) `npm install -g bower`
* Yarn: [installation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

If Yarn is difficult to install, you can also skip it, and install the Node packages using `npm install` below.

### Setup Brunch and Project Libraries

You'll need to install the plugins required for the brunch project, as well
as libraries the project depends on.

```
  yarn (or `npm install`)
  bower install
```

### Starting the Server

Run this command:

```
  npm start
```

Note, you may see errors of the form "Could not load module [x] from [y]" in the console. These can be ignored.

Now open http://localhost:3333. Whenever you make a change to a file the
browser will be automatically refreshed.

Your files will automatically be built into the /public directory
whenever they change.

You can also just run `brunch build` to simply build the files into /public without starting
the server.
